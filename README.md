With OpenTBS you can merge LibreOffice, OpenOffice and Ms Office documents with PHP using the TinyButStrong template engine.
Simple use OpenOffice - LibreOffice or Ms Office to edit your templates : DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODT, ODS, ODP and other formats.
That is the Natural Template philosophy.

Now OpenTBS can also read data in workbooks (XLSX and ODS files).
